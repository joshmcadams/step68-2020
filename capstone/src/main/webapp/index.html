            Welcome to our site! We are excited to teach you just how cool computer science
            can be. Even if you don't know what computer science is, you can learn the basics
            here and make cool programs!
        </p>

        <h2>Why should I learn?</h2>
        <p>
            Computer Science is the language of the future!
            <br><br>
            Every piece of technology you have uses computer science. It is how we talk to machines
            and have them do what we want. Don't believe us? Well, maybe we're wrong. Try and pick 
            one of the options you think doesn't use computer science:

            This was a trick question! Everything I included as a choice uses 
            computer science! So, do you want to learn how to use it to?
