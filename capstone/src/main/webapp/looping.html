      <p>I'm sure you've seen this symbol on many of your favorite websites and apps.
        It keeps moving the smaller circles in a circle until something is loaded or we exit.
        This is a prime example of looping! Looping allows us to do a certain task over and over and over
        (until we decide to stop it or it reaches a certain condition).
        We can also track what happens between each loop iteration!

      <p>For example, everytime a basketball player (let's say Stephen Curry) shoots from behind the three
        point line and scores, they earn three points to their point total.
        Stephen Curry currently has six points. He takes five three-point shots and makes four of them.
        How many total points does Stephen Curry currently have?

      <p>In Computer Science, the two most common types of looping statements are <b>while
        loops</b> and <b>for loops</b>. <b>While loops</b> keep running a certain action
        <i>while</i> a certain condition is or is not met. <b>For loops</b> keep running
        a certain action <i>for</i> a certain duration, while keeping count of how many times
        it has ran with an iterator (or counter) variable. Both of these looping statements
        are great to use, so it depends on your preference as to which one you want
        to use.
