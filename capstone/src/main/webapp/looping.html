      <p>I'm sure you've seen this symbol on many of your favorite websites and apps.
        It keeps moving the smaller circle in a circular motion until something is loaded or we exit.
        This is a prime example of looping! Looping allows us to do a certain task over and over and over
        (until we decide to stop it or it reaches a certain condition).
        We can also track what happens between each loop iteration!

      <p>For example, let's track Stephen Curry's three-point attempts.
        Everytime Stephen Curry shoots from behind the three-point line and scores,
        he earns three points to his point total.
        Stephen Curry currently has six points. He takes five three-point shots and makes four of them.
        How many total points does Stephen Curry currently have?
      </p>
      <div id="dropdown">
        <label for="ten">Choose the point total:</label>
        <select id="selectpoints" name="points">
          <option value="twelve">Twelve</option>
          <option value="fourteen">Fourteen</option>
          <option value="eighteen">Eighteen</option>
          <option value="ten">Ten</option>

      </div>
      <p id="right"><b>Eighteen is correct! Stephen Curry started with six points and made five three-pointers.
        By looping through each shot attempt he made, the point total ends up being eighteen points!</b></p>
      <p id="wrong"><b>Your answer is incorrect. Try again.</b></p>

      <p>In Computer Science, the two most common types of looping statements are <b>while
        loops</b> and <b>for loops</b>.
        <br>
        <b>While loops</b> keep running a certain action <i>while</i> a certain condition
        is or is not met.
        <br>
        <b>For loops</b> keep running a certain action <i>for</i> a certain duration,
        while internally keeping count of how many times it has ran with an iterator (or counter) variable.
        <br>
        Both of these looping statements are great to use, so it depends on
        your preference as to which one you want to use.

      <p class="explanation">The <b>number</b> variable is created to store the value of an integer.</p>
      <p class="explanation">This function uses a <b>for loop</b>. A for loop has three required items
        within its parenthesis: a counter variable, a conditional statement, and an incrementer/decrementer.
        The <b>i=0;</b> creates the counter variable for the loop. The <b>i&#60;3;</b> is the conditional
        statement. If <b>i</b> is less than three, than it will run the for loop, or else it moves to line 6.
        The <b>i++;</b> is the incrementer for the loop. Once the for loop runs through each line within itself,
        it keeps incrementing the <b>i</b> counter and runs lines 3-4 until the conditional statement is false.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The <b>number++;</b> line adds one to the total of the variable <b>number</b>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The <b>console.writeln("Current Number: " + number);</b> line is a print statement.
        What this means is that the page will display whatever is inside of the parenthesis. 
        Since number is an integer variable, the page will print the value of the variable at its certain point.
        So in this case, the page will print, <b>Current Number: <b>the value of number</b></b>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The curly bracket encloses the for loop.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Once the for loop has ran three times, it exits the loop 
        then displays the final number with the 
        <b>"console.writeln("Final Number: " + number);"</b> statement.

      <p>This was just a basic loop, as looping can become very complex and confusing!
        Getting the basics of looping down early will help you when it comes to looping through
        complex problems!
